what about the interface?
scrolling through an update, a panel on the right that toggles between notes, comments and off, and the date annd craetor are on a panel above the update. 
there's always an address type of thing on top left that shows you the directory you're at, also the person you're logged in as.
it's all about ideas
spend more time on these, you'll find so much new stuff.
for logging, honestly idk.

for tracking progression, there's both a meter and a tasks done to all tasks ratio. 
task assignment? adding users? argparse?
users should be defined in project, not something like github.
user id and name being saved is fine. actually just id, you can get the other stuff from that.

there's also maybe a panic mode if due date is short. a smart system that hides exra features if there's much to do still, etc. this can maybe be turned off too.
have a demo project that is a reference to how they didn't give you full mark.

how about contributions? progress? permissions?

how to get input for things like names for the project?

a lot of quick shortcuts to do things, most terminal related. a command system type of thing.
